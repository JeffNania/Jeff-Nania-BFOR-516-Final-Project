Final Project 



Data

The data for this project comes from UCI Machine Learning, but is available at Kaggle through the 
following link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database . The data is originally from
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The patients considered in this dataset 
are all females above the age of 21 of Pima Indian Heritage. The Pima people are a group of Native Americans
who live in what is now south and central Arizona as well as northwestern Mexico. 

This data set considers factors such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, body mass index, age, and more 
to attempt to predict whether or not an individual has diabetes.  



Questions

What factor or factors seem to be most closely linked with diabetes?


Which models seem to perform the best for this prediction?


Do the models perform best when considering all the factors or just some of the factors?
